    <h2>
      Hi, I'm Sarah.
    </h2>
    <h1>
      I strive for excellence through learning.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring product manager and full-stack engineer with a passion for creating impactful digital solutions. With a foundation built on curiosity and continuous learning, I’ve designed projects across diverse domains, focusing on social media platforms and productivity tools. At Google, I gained invaluable experience leading global projects that touched millions of users, and my Masters of Business Administration from San Jose State University has equipped me to manage teams and deliver products at scale.
      Having graduated from App Academy, I continue to refine my technical skills by building robust applications that merge functionality with elegance. My projects, including an Airbnb clone and a Spotify Hall of Fame app, reflect my commitment to crafting intuitive user experiences. My current project, a productivity timer, blends simplicity with utility to visually separate working and resting time, enhancing time management.

      Rest
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, I explore activities that bring joy and balance to my life. I love globe-trotting, with Iceland 2026 on my bucket list to witness the total solar eclipse, and staying active at the gym where I strive to perfect my muscle-up. In the kitchen, I find joy experimenting with recipes, crafting meals that bring people together, featuring creative dishes such as "The Cannibal's Bird's Nest" and traditional ones, such as my family's signature teriyaki salmon. My obsession with efficiency finds expression in building spreadsheets to organize every aspect of life, combining functionality with a touch of personal flair.
