    <h2>
      🌲 Hi, I'm Sarah.
    </h2>
    <h1>
      I connect people and create lasting, meaningful experiences.

    <h2>
      Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      I lead wiith intention, resilience, and pragmatism.I am a program manager with a passion for creating impactful events and digital solutions. Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I’ve led projects across diverse domains, ranging from virtual social media initiatives to in-person feedback days with developers from some of the top companies in the world. At Google, I’ve gained invaluable experience leading global projects that reach millions of users, and my MBA from San José State University has equipped me to manage teams and deliver products at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also bring a strong technical foundation as an App Academy graduate, where I continue to refine my skills by building applications that balance functionality with elegance. My projects, including an Airbnb clone and a Spotify Hall of Fame app, reflect my focus on intuitive user experiences. My current technical project is a productivity timer designed to visually separate work and rest, and I’m also working on a non-technical creative project by producing a vlog in DaVinci Resolve documenting a 14-person trip to Las Vegas that I organized and led.
    </p>

      Rest
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not working on my projects, I explore activities that bring joy and balance to my life. I love globe-trotting, with Spain 2027 on my bucket list to witness the total solar eclipse, and staying active at the gym where I strive to perfect my muscle-up. In the kitchen, I find joy experimenting with recipes, crafting meals that bring people together, featuring creative dishes such as "The Cannibal's Bird's Nest" and traditional ones, such as my family's signature teriyaki salmon. My obsession with efficiency finds expression in building spreadsheets to organize every aspect of life, combining functionality with a touch of personal flair.
